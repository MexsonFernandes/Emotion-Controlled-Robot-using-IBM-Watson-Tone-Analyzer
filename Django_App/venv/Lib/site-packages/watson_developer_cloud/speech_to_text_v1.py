The IBM&reg; Speech to Text service provides an API that uses IBM's speech-recognition
capabilities to produce transcripts of spoken audio. The service can transcribe speech
from various languages and audio formats. It addition to basic transcription, the service
can produce detailed information about many aspects of the audio. For most languages, the
service supports two sampling rates, broadband and narrowband. It returns all JSON
response content in the UTF-8 character set. For more information about the service, see
the [IBM&reg; Cloud
documentation](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/index.html).
### API usage guidelines
* **Audio formats:** The service accepts audio in many formats (MIME types). See [Audio
formats](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/audio-formats.html).
* **HTTP interfaces:** The service provides three HTTP interfaces for speech recognition.
The sessionless interface includes a single synchronous method. The session-based
interface includes multiple synchronous methods for maintaining a long, multi-turn
exchange with the service. And the asynchronous interface provides multiple methods that
use registered callbacks and polling for non-blocking recognition. See [The HTTP REST
interface](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/http.html) and [The
asynchronous HTTP
interface](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/async.html).
* **WebSocket interface:** The service also offers a WebSocket interface for speech
recognition. The WebSocket interface provides a full-duplex, low-latency communication
channel. Clients send requests and audio to the service and receive results over a single
connection in an asynchronous fashion. See [The WebSocket
interface](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/websockets.html).
* **Customization:** Use language model customization to expand the vocabulary of a base
model with domain-specific terminology. Use acoustic model customization to adapt a base
model for the acoustic characteristics of your audio. Language model customization is
generally available for production use by most supported languages; acoustic model
customization is beta functionality that is available for all supported languages. See
[The customization
interface](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/custom.html).
* **Customization IDs:** Many methods accept a customization ID to identify a custom
language or custom acoustic model. Customization IDs are Globally Unique Identifiers
(GUIDs). They are hexadecimal strings that have the format
`xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`.
* **`X-Watson-Learning-Opt-Out`:** By default, all Watson services log requests and their
results. Logging is done only to improve the services for future users. The logged data is
not shared or made public. To prevent IBM from accessing your data for general service
improvements, set the `X-Watson-Learning-Opt-Out` request header to `true` for all
requests. You must set the header on each request that you do not want IBM to access for
general service improvements.
  Methods of the customization interface do not log corpora, words, and audio resources
that you use to build custom models. Your training data is never used to improve the
service's base models. However, the service does log such data when a custom model is used
with a recognition request. You must set the `X-Watson-Learning-Opt-Out` request header to
`true` to prevent IBM from accessing the data to improve the service.
* **`X-Watson-Metadata`**: This header allows you to associate a customer ID with data
that is passed with a request. If necessary, you can use the **Delete labeled data**
method to delete the data for a customer ID. See [Information
security](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/information-security.html).

        """
        Recognize audio (sessionless).

        Sends audio and returns transcription results for a sessionless recognition
        request. Returns only the final results; to enable interim results, use
        session-based requests or the WebSocket API. The service imposes a data size limit
        of 100 MB. It automatically detects the endianness of the incoming audio and, for
        audio that includes multiple channels, downmixes the audio to one-channel mono
        during transcoding. (For the `audio/l16` format, you can specify the endianness.)
        ### Streaming mode
         For requests to transcribe live audio as it becomes available, you must set the
        `Transfer-Encoding` header to `chunked` to use streaming mode. In streaming mode,
        the server closes the connection (status code 408) if the service receives no data
        chunk for 30 seconds and the service has no audio to transcribe for 30 seconds.
        The server also closes the connection (status code 400) if no speech is detected
        for `inactivity_timeout` seconds of audio (not processing time); use the
        `inactivity_timeout` parameter to change the default of 30 seconds.
        ### Audio formats (content types)
         Use the `Content-Type` header to specify the audio format (MIME type) of the
        audio. The service accepts the following formats:
        * `audio/basic` (Use only with narrowband models.)
        * `audio/flac`
        * `audio/l16` (Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) and optionally the number of
        channels (`channels`) and endianness (`endianness`) of the audio.)
        * `audio/mp3`
        * `audio/mpeg`
        * `audio/mulaw` (Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) of the audio.)
        * `audio/ogg` (The service automatically detects the codec of the input audio.)
        * `audio/ogg;codecs=opus`
        * `audio/ogg;codecs=vorbis`
        * `audio/wav` (Provide audio with a maximum of nine channels.)
        * `audio/webm` (The service automatically detects the codec of the input audio.)
        * `audio/webm;codecs=opus`
        * `audio/webm;codecs=vorbis`
        For information about the supported audio formats, including specifying the
        sampling rate, channels, and endianness for the indicated formats, see [Audio
        formats](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/audio-formats.html).
        ### Multipart speech recognition
         The method also supports multipart recognition requests. With multipart requests,
        you pass all audio data as multipart form data. You specify some parameters as
        request headers and query parameters, but you pass JSON metadata as form data to
        control most aspects of the transcription.
        The multipart approach is intended for use with browsers for which JavaScript is
        disabled or when the parameters used with the request are greater than the 8 KB
        limit imposed by most HTTP servers and proxies. You can encounter this limit, for
        example, if you want to spot a very large number of keywords.
        For information about submitting a multipart request, see [Submitting multipart
        requests as form
        data](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/http.html#HTTP-multi).

        :param str model: The identifier of the model that is to be used for the
        recognition request or, for the **Create a session** method, with the new session.
        :param str customization_id: The customization ID (GUID) of a custom language
        model that is to be used with the recognition request or, for the **Create a
        session** method, with the new session. The base model of the specified custom
        language model must match the model specified with the `model` parameter. You must
        make the request with service credentials created for the instance of the service
        that owns the custom model. By default, no custom language model is used.
        :param str acoustic_customization_id: The customization ID (GUID) of a custom
        acoustic model that is to be used with the recognition request or, for the
        **Create a session** method, with the new session. The base model of the specified
        custom acoustic model must match the model specified with the `model` parameter.
        You must make the request with service credentials created for the instance of the
        service that owns the custom model. By default, no custom acoustic model is used.
        :param float customization_weight: If you specify the customization ID (GUID) of a
        custom language model with the recognition request or, for sessions, with the
        **Create a session** method, the customization weight tells the service how much
        weight to give to words from the custom language model compared to those from the
        base model for the current request.
        Specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0. Unless a different customization weight was
        specified for the custom model when it was trained, the default value is 0.3. A
        customization weight that you specify overrides a weight that was specified when
        the custom model was trained.
        The default value yields the best performance in general. Assign a higher value if
        your audio makes frequent use of OOV words from the custom model. Use caution when
        setting the weight: a higher value can improve the accuracy of phrases from the
        custom model's domain, but it can negatively affect performance on non-domain
        phrases.
        :param str version: The version of the specified base model that is to
        be used with recognition request or, for the **Create a session** method, with the
        new session. Multiple versions of a base model can exist when a model is updated
        for internal improvements. The parameter is intended primarily for use with custom
        models that have been upgraded for a new base model. The default value depends on
        whether the parameter is used with or without a custom model. For more
        information, see [Base model
        version](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#version).
        :param str audio: The audio to transcribe in the format specified by the
        `Content-Type` header.
        :param str content_type: The type of the input: audio/basic, audio/flac,
        audio/l16, audio/mp3, audio/mpeg, audio/mulaw, audio/ogg, audio/ogg;codecs=opus,
        audio/ogg;codecs=vorbis, audio/wav, audio/webm, audio/webm;codecs=opus, or
        audio/webm;codecs=vorbis.
        :param int inactivity_timeout: The time in seconds after which, if only silence
        (no speech) is detected in submitted audio, the connection is closed with a 400
        error. Useful for stopping audio submission from a live microphone when a user
        simply walks away. Use `-1` for infinity.
        :param list[str] keywords: An array of keyword strings to spot in the audio. Each
        keyword string can include one or more tokens. Keywords are spotted only in the
        final hypothesis, not in interim results. If you specify any keywords, you must
        also specify a keywords threshold. You can spot a maximum of 1000 keywords. Omit
        the parameter or specify an empty array if you do not need to spot keywords.
        :param float keywords_threshold: A confidence value that is the lower bound for
        spotting a keyword. A word is considered to match a keyword if its confidence is
        greater than or equal to the threshold. Specify a probability between 0 and 1
        inclusive. No keyword spotting is performed if you omit the parameter. If you
        specify a threshold, you must also specify one or more keywords.
        :param int max_alternatives: The maximum number of alternative transcripts to be
        returned. By default, a single transcription is returned.
        :param float word_alternatives_threshold: A confidence value that is the lower
        bound for identifying a hypothesis as a possible word alternative (also known as
        \"Confusion Networks\"). An alternative word is considered if its confidence is
        greater than or equal to the threshold. Specify a probability between 0 and 1
        inclusive. No alternative words are computed if you omit the parameter.
        :param bool word_confidence: If `true`, a confidence measure in the range of 0 to
        1 is returned for each word. By default, no word confidence measures are returned.
        :param bool timestamps: If `true`, time alignment is returned for each word. By
        default, no timestamps are returned.
        :param bool profanity_filter: If `true` (the default), filters profanity from all
        output except for keyword results by replacing inappropriate words with a series
        of asterisks. Set the parameter to `false` to return results with no censoring.
        Applies to US English transcription only.
        :param bool smart_formatting: If `true`, converts dates, times, series of digits
        and numbers, phone numbers, currency values, and internet addresses into more
        readable, conventional representations in the final transcript of a recognition
        request. For US English, also converts certain keyword strings to punctuation
        symbols. By default, no smart formatting is performed. Applies to US English and
        Spanish transcription only.
        :param bool speaker_labels: If `true`, the response includes labels that identify
        which words were spoken by which participants in a multi-person exchange. By
        default, no speaker labels are returned. Setting `speaker_labels` to `true` forces
        the `timestamps` parameter to be `true`, regardless of whether you specify `false`
        for the parameter.
         To determine whether a language model supports speaker labels, use the **Get
        models** method and check that the attribute `speaker_labels` is set to `true`.
        You can also refer to [Speaker
        labels](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/output.html#speaker_labels).

        Sends audio for speech recognition using web sockets.

        :param str model: The identifier of the model that is to be used for the
        recognition request or, for the **Create a session** method, with the new session.
        :param str customization_id: The customization ID (GUID) of a custom language
        model that is to be used with the recognition request or, for the **Create a
        session** method, with the new session. The base model of the specified custom
        language model must match the model specified with the `model` parameter. You must
        make the request with service credentials created for the instance of the service
        that owns the custom model. By default, no custom language model is used.
        :param str acoustic_customization_id: The customization ID (GUID) of a custom
        acoustic model that is to be used with the recognition request or, for the
        **Create a session** method, with the new session. The base model of the specified
        custom acoustic model must match the model specified with the `model` parameter.
        You must make the request with service credentials created for the instance of the
        service that owns the custom model. By default, no custom acoustic model is used.
        :param float customization_weight: If you specify the customization ID (GUID) of a
        custom language model with the recognition request or, for sessions, with the
        **Create a session** method, the customization weight tells the service how much
        weight to give to words from the custom language model compared to those from the
        base model for the current request.
        Specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0. Unless a different customization weight was
        specified for the custom model when it was trained, the default value is 0.3. A
        customization weight that you specify overrides a weight that was specified when
        the custom model was trained.
        The default value yields the best performance in general. Assign a higher value if
        your audio makes frequent use of OOV words from the custom model. Use caution when
        setting the weight: a higher value can improve the accuracy of phrases from the
        custom model's domain, but it can negatively affect performance on non-domain
        phrases.
        :param str version: The version of the specified base model that is to
        be used with recognition request or, for the **Create a session** method, with the
        new session. Multiple versions of a base model can exist when a model is updated
        for internal improvements. The parameter is intended primarily for use with custom
        models that have been upgraded for a new base model. The default value depends on
        whether the parameter is used with or without a custom model. For more
        information, see [Base model
        version](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#version).
        :param str audio: The audio to transcribe in the format specified by the
        `Content-Type` header.
        :param str content_type: The type of the input: audio/basic, audio/flac,
        audio/l16, audio/mp3, audio/mpeg, audio/mulaw, audio/ogg, audio/ogg;codecs=opus,
        audio/ogg;codecs=vorbis, audio/wav, audio/webm, audio/webm;codecs=opus, or
        audio/webm;codecs=vorbis.
        :param int inactivity_timeout: The time in seconds after which, if only silence
        (no speech) is detected in submitted audio, the connection is closed with a 400
        error. Useful for stopping audio submission from a live microphone when a user
        simply walks away. Use `-1` for infinity.
        :param list[str] keywords: An array of keyword strings to spot in the audio. Each
        keyword string can include one or more tokens. Keywords are spotted only in the
        final hypothesis, not in interim results. If you specify any keywords, you must
        also specify a keywords threshold. You can spot a maximum of 1000 keywords. Omit
        the parameter or specify an empty array if you do not need to spot keywords.
        :param float keywords_threshold: A confidence value that is the lower bound for
        spotting a keyword. A word is considered to match a keyword if its confidence is
        greater than or equal to the threshold. Specify a probability between 0 and 1
        inclusive. No keyword spotting is performed if you omit the parameter. If you
        specify a threshold, you must also specify one or more keywords.
        :param int max_alternatives: The maximum number of alternative transcripts to be
        returned. By default, a single transcription is returned.
        :param float word_alternatives_threshold: A confidence value that is the lower
        bound for identifying a hypothesis as a possible word alternative (also known as
        \"Confusion Networks\"). An alternative word is considered if its confidence is
        greater than or equal to the threshold. Specify a probability between 0 and 1
        inclusive. No alternative words are computed if you omit the parameter.
        :param bool word_confidence: If `true`, a confidence measure in the range of 0 to
        1 is returned for each word. By default, no word confidence measures are returned.
        :param bool timestamps: If `true`, time alignment is returned for each word. By
        default, no timestamps are returned.
        :param bool profanity_filter: If `true` (the default), filters profanity from all
        output except for keyword results by replacing inappropriate words with a series
        of asterisks. Set the parameter to `false` to return results with no censoring.
        Applies to US English transcription only.
        :param bool smart_formatting: If `true`, converts dates, times, series of digits
        and numbers, phone numbers, currency values, and internet addresses into more
        readable, conventional representations in the final transcript of a recognition
        request. For US English, also converts certain keyword strings to punctuation
        symbols. By default, no smart formatting is performed. Applies to US English and
        Spanish transcription only.
        :param bool speaker_labels: If `true`, the response includes labels that identify
        which words were spoken by which participants in a multi-person exchange. By
        default, no speaker labels are returned. Setting `speaker_labels` to `true` forces
        the `timestamps` parameter to be `true`, regardless of whether you specify `false`
        for the parameter.
         To determine whether a language model supports speaker labels, use the **Get
        models** method and check that the attribute `speaker_labels` is set to `true`.

        Create a job.

        Creates a job for a new asynchronous recognition request. The job is owned by the
        user whose service credentials are used to create it. How you learn the status and
        results of a job depends on the parameters you include with the job creation
        request:
        * By callback notification: Include the `callback_url` parameter to specify a URL
        to which the service is to send callback notifications when the status of the job
        changes. Optionally, you can also include the `events` and `user_token` parameters
        to subscribe to specific events and to specify a string that is to be included
        with each notification for the job.
        * By polling the service: Omit the `callback_url`, `events`, and `user_token`
        parameters. You must then use the **Check jobs** or **Check a job** methods to
        check the status of the job, using the latter to retrieve the results when the job
        is complete.
        The two approaches are not mutually exclusive. You can poll the service for job
        status or obtain results from the service manually even if you include a callback
        URL. In both cases, you can include the `results_ttl` parameter to specify how
        long the results are to remain available after the job is complete. For detailed
        usage information about the two approaches, including callback notifications, see
        [Creating a
        job](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/async.html#create).
        Using the HTTPS **Check a job** method to retrieve results is more secure than
        receiving them via callback notification over HTTP because it provides
        confidentiality in addition to authentication and data integrity.
        The method supports the same basic parameters as other HTTP and WebSocket
        recognition requests. The service imposes a data size limit of 100 MB. It
        automatically detects the endianness of the incoming audio and, for audio that
        includes multiple channels, downmixes the audio to one-channel mono during
        transcoding. (For the `audio/l16` format, you can specify the endianness.)
        ### Audio formats (content types)
         Use the `Content-Type` parameter to specify the audio format (MIME type) of the
        audio:
        * `audio/basic` (Use only with narrowband models.)
        * `audio/flac`
        * `audio/l16` (Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) and optionally the number of
        channels (`channels`) and endianness (`endianness`) of the audio.)
        * `audio/mp3`
        * `audio/mpeg`
        * `audio/mulaw` (Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) of the audio.)
        * `audio/ogg` (The service automatically detects the codec of the input audio.)
        * `audio/ogg;codecs=opus`
        * `audio/ogg;codecs=vorbis`
        * `audio/wav` (Provide audio with a maximum of nine channels.)
        * `audio/webm` (The service automatically detects the codec of the input audio.)
        * `audio/webm;codecs=opus`
        * `audio/webm;codecs=vorbis`
        For information about the supported audio formats, including specifying the
        sampling rate, channels, and endianness for the indicated formats, see [Audio
        formats](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/audio-formats.html).

        :param str audio: The audio to transcribe in the format specified by the
        `Content-Type` header.
        :param str content_type: The type of the input: audio/basic, audio/flac,
        audio/l16, audio/mp3, audio/mpeg, audio/mulaw, audio/ogg, audio/ogg;codecs=opus,
        audio/ogg;codecs=vorbis, audio/wav, audio/webm, audio/webm;codecs=opus, or
        audio/webm;codecs=vorbis.
        :param str model: The identifier of the model that is to be used for the
        recognition request or, for the **Create a session** method, with the new session.
        :param str callback_url: A URL to which callback notifications are to be sent. The
        URL must already be successfully white-listed by using the **Register a callback**
        method. Omit the parameter to poll the service for job completion and results. You
        can include the same callback URL with any number of job creation requests. Use
        the `user_token` parameter to specify a unique user-specified string with each job
        to differentiate the callback notifications for the jobs.
        :param str events: If the job includes a callback URL, a comma-separated list of
        notification events to which to subscribe. Valid events are:
        `recognitions.started` generates a callback notification when the service begins
        to process the job. `recognitions.completed` generates a callback notification
        when the job is complete; you must use the **Check a job** method to retrieve the
        results before they time out or are deleted. `recognitions.completed_with_results`
        generates a callback notification when the job is complete; the notification
        includes the results of the request. `recognitions.failed` generates a callback
        notification if the service experiences an error while processing the job. Omit
        the parameter to subscribe to the default events: `recognitions.started`,
        `recognitions.completed`, and `recognitions.failed`. The `recognitions.completed`
        and `recognitions.completed_with_results` events are incompatible; you can specify
        only of the two events. If the job does not include a callback URL, omit the
        parameter.
        :param str user_token: If the job includes a callback URL, a user-specified string
        that the service is to include with each callback notification for the job; the
        token allows the user to maintain an internal mapping between jobs and
        notification events. If the job does not include a callback URL, omit the
        parameter.
        :param int results_ttl: The number of minutes for which the results are to be
        available after the job has finished. If not delivered via a callback, the results
        must be retrieved within this time. Omit the parameter to use a time to live of
        one week. The parameter is valid with or without a callback URL.
        :param str customization_id: The customization ID (GUID) of a custom language
        model that is to be used with the recognition request or, for the **Create a
        session** method, with the new session. The base model of the specified custom
        language model must match the model specified with the `model` parameter. You must
        make the request with service credentials created for the instance of the service
        that owns the custom model. By default, no custom language model is used.
        :param str acoustic_customization_id: The customization ID (GUID) of a custom
        acoustic model that is to be used with the recognition request or, for the
        **Create a session** method, with the new session. The base model of the specified
        custom acoustic model must match the model specified with the `model` parameter.
        You must make the request with service credentials created for the instance of the
        service that owns the custom model. By default, no custom acoustic model is used.
        :param float customization_weight: If you specify the customization ID (GUID) of a
        custom language model with the recognition request or, for sessions, with the
        **Create a session** method, the customization weight tells the service how much
        weight to give to words from the custom language model compared to those from the
        base model for the current request.
        Specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0. Unless a different customization weight was
        specified for the custom model when it was trained, the default value is 0.3. A
        customization weight that you specify overrides a weight that was specified when
        the custom model was trained.
        The default value yields the best performance in general. Assign a higher value if
        your audio makes frequent use of OOV words from the custom model. Use caution when
        setting the weight: a higher value can improve the accuracy of phrases from the
        custom model's domain, but it can negatively affect performance on non-domain
        :param str version: The version of the specified base model that is to
        be used with recognition request or, for the **Create a session** method, with the
        new session. Multiple versions of a base model can exist when a model is updated
        for internal improvements. The parameter is intended primarily for use with custom
        models that have been upgraded for a new base model. The default value depends on
        whether the parameter is used with or without a custom model. For more

        spotting a keyword. A word is considered to match a keyword if its confidence is
        greater than or equal to the threshold. Specify a probability between 0 and 1
        inclusive. No keyword spotting is performed if you omit the parameter. If you
        specify a threshold, you must also specify one or more keywords.
        :param int max_alternatives: The maximum number of alternative transcripts to be
        returned. By default, a single transcription is returned.
        :param float word_alternatives_threshold: A confidence value that is the lower
        bound for identifying a hypothesis as a possible word alternative (also known as
        \"Confusion Networks\"). An alternative word is considered if its confidence is
        greater than or equal to the threshold. Specify a probability between 0 and 1
        inclusive. No alternative words are computed if you omit the parameter.
        :param bool word_confidence: If `true`, a confidence measure in the range of 0 to
        1 is returned for each word. By default, no word confidence measures are returned.
        :param bool timestamps: If `true`, time alignment is returned for each word. By
        default, no timestamps are returned.
        :param bool profanity_filter: If `true` (the default), filters profanity from all
        output except for keyword results by replacing inappropriate words with a series
        of asterisks. Set the parameter to `false` to return results with no censoring.
        Applies to US English transcription only.
        :param bool smart_formatting: If `true`, converts dates, times, series of digits
        and numbers, phone numbers, currency values, and internet addresses into more
        readable, conventional representations in the final transcript of a recognition
        request. For US English, also converts certain keyword strings to punctuation
        symbols. By default, no smart formatting is performed. Applies to US English and
        Spanish transcription only.
        :param bool speaker_labels: If `true`, the response includes labels that identify
        which words were spoken by which participants in a multi-person exchange. By
        default, no speaker labels are returned. Setting `speaker_labels` to `true` forces
        the `timestamps` parameter to be `true`, regardless of whether you specify `false`
        for the parameter.
         To determine whether a language model supports speaker labels, use the **Get
        models** method and check that the attribute `speaker_labels` is set to `true`.

        Register a callback.

        Registers a callback URL with the service for use with subsequent asynchronous
        recognition requests. The service attempts to register, or white-list, the
        callback URL if it is not already registered by sending a `GET` request to the
        callback URL. The service passes a random alphanumeric challenge string via the
        `challenge_string` parameter of the request. The request includes an `Accept`
        header that specifies `text/plain` as the required response type.
        To be registered successfully, the callback URL must respond to the `GET` request
        from the service. The response must send status code 200 and must include the
        challenge string in its body. Set the `Content-Type` response header to
        `text/plain`. Upon receiving this response, the service responds to the original
        registration request with response code 201.
        The service sends only a single `GET` request to the callback URL. If the service
        does not receive a reply with a response code of 200 and a body that echoes the
        challenge string sent by the service within five seconds, it does not white-list
        the URL; it instead sends status code 400 in response to the **Register a
        callback** request. If the requested callback URL is already white-listed, the
        service responds to the initial registration request with response code 200.
        If you specify a user secret with the request, the service uses it as a key to
        calculate an HMAC-SHA1 signature of the challenge string in its response to the
        `POST` request. It sends this signature in the `X-Callback-Signature` header of
        its `GET` request to the URL during registration. It also uses the secret to
        calculate a signature over the payload of every callback notification that uses
        the URL. The signature provides authentication and data integrity for HTTP
        communications.
        After you successfully register a callback URL, you can use it with an indefinite
        number of recognition requests. You can register a maximum of 20 callback URLS in
        a one-hour span of time. For more information, see [Registering a callback

        :param str callback_url: An HTTP or HTTPS URL to which callback notifications are
        to be sent. To be white-listed, the URL must successfully echo the challenge
        string during URL verification. During verification, the client can also check the
        signature that the service sends in the `X-Callback-Signature` header to verify
        the origin of the request.
        :param str user_secret: A user-specified string that the service uses to generate
        the HMAC-SHA1 signature that it sends via the `X-Callback-Signature` header. The

        Train a custom language model.

        Initiates the training of a custom language model with new corpora, custom words,
        or both. After adding, modifying, or deleting corpora or words for a custom
        language model, use this method to begin the actual training of the model on the
        latest data. You can specify whether the custom language model is to be trained
        with all words from its words resource or only with words that were added or
        modified by the user. You must use credentials for the instance of the service
        that owns a model to train it.
        The training method is asynchronous. It can take on the order of minutes to
        complete depending on the amount of data on which the service is being trained and
        the current load on the service. The method returns an HTTP 200 response code to
        indicate that the training process has begun.
        You can monitor the status of the training by using the **List a custom language
        model** method to poll the model's status. Use a loop to check the status every 10
        seconds. The method returns a `Customization` object that includes `status` and
        `progress` fields. A status of `available` means that the custom model is trained
        and ready to use. The service cannot accept subsequent training requests, or
        requests to add new corpora or words, until the existing request completes.
        Training can fail to start for the following reasons:
        * The service is currently handling another request for the custom model, such as
        another training request or a request to add a corpus or words to the model.
        * No training data (corpora or words) have been added to the custom model.
        * One or more words that were added to the custom model have invalid sounds-like

        of the service that owns the custom model.
        :param str word_type_to_add: The type of words from the custom language model's
        words resource on which to train the model:
        * `all` (the default) trains the model on all new words, regardless of whether
        they were extracted from corpora or were added or modified by the user.
        * `user` trains the model only on new words that were added or modified by the
        user; the model is not trained on new words extracted from corpora.
        :param float customization_weight: Specifies a customization weight for the custom
        language model. The customization weight tells the service how much weight to give
        to words from the custom language model compared to those from the base model for
        speech recognition. Specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0; the default is 0.3.
        The default value yields the best performance in general. Assign a higher value if
        your audio makes frequent use of OOV words from the custom model. Use caution when
        setting the weight: a higher value can improve the accuracy of phrases from the
        custom model's domain, but it can negatively affect performance on non-domain

        minutes to complete depending on the amount of data in the custom model and the

        Add a corpus.

        Adds a single corpus text file of new training data to a custom language model.
        Use multiple requests to submit multiple corpus text files. You must use
        credentials for the instance of the service that owns a model to add a corpus to
        it. Adding a corpus does not affect the custom language model until you train the
        model for the new data by using the **Train a custom language model** method.
        Submit a plain text file that contains sample sentences from the domain of
        interest to enable the service to extract words in context. The more sentences you
        add that represent the context in which speakers use words from the domain, the
        better the service's recognition accuracy. For guidelines about adding a corpus
        text file and for information about how the service parses a corpus file, see
        [Preparing a corpus text
        file](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/language-resource.html#prepareCorpus).
        The call returns an HTTP 201 response code if the corpus is valid. The service
        then asynchronously processes the contents of the corpus and automatically
        extracts new words that it finds. This can take on the order of a minute or two to
        complete depending on the total number of words and the number of new words in the
        corpus, as well as the current load on the service. You cannot submit requests to
        add additional corpora or words to the custom model, or to train the model, until
        the service's analysis of the corpus for the current request completes. Use the
        **List a corpus** method to check the status of the analysis.
        The service auto-populates the model's words resource with any word that is not
        found in its base vocabulary; these are referred to as out-of-vocabulary (OOV)
        words. You can use the **List custom words** method to examine the words resource,
        using other words method to eliminate typos and modify how words are pronounced as
        needed.
        To add a corpus file that has the same name as an existing corpus, set the
        `allow_overwrite` parameter to `true`; otherwise, the request fails. Overwriting
        an existing corpus causes the service to process the corpus text file and extract
        OOV words anew. Before doing so, it removes any OOV words associated with the
        existing corpus from the model's words resource unless they were also added by
        another corpus or they have been modified in some way with the **Add custom
        words** or **Add a custom word** method.
        The service limits the overall amount of data that you can add to a custom model
        to a maximum of 10 million total words from all corpora combined. Also, you can
        add no more than 30 thousand custom (OOV) words to a model; this includes words
        that the service extracts from corpora and words that you add directly.

        `--data-binary` option to upload the file for the request.
        :param bool allow_overwrite: If `true`, the specified corpus or audio resource

        """
        Add an audio resource.

        Adds an audio resource to a custom acoustic model. Add audio content that reflects
        the acoustic characteristics of the audio that you plan to transcribe. You must
        use credentials for the instance of the service that owns a model to add an audio
        resource to it. Adding audio data does not affect the custom acoustic model until
        you train the model for the new data by using the **Train a custom acoustic
        model** method.
        You can add individual audio files or an archive file that contains multiple audio
        files. Adding multiple audio files via a single archive file is significantly more
        efficient than adding each file individually. You can add audio resources in any
        format that the service supports for speech recognition.
        You can use this method to add any number of audio resources to a custom model by
        calling the method once for each audio or archive file. But the addition of one
        audio resource must be fully complete before you can add another. You must add a
        minimum of 10 minutes and a maximum of 50 hours of audio that includes speech, not
        just silence, to a custom acoustic model before you can train it. No audio
        resource, audio- or archive-type, can be larger than 100 MB. To add an audio
        resource that has the same name as an existing audio resource, set the
        `allow_overwrite` parameter to `true`; otherwise, the request fails.
        The method is asynchronous. It can take several seconds to complete depending on
        the duration of the audio and, in the case of an archive file, the total number of
        audio files being processed. The service returns a 201 response code if the audio
        is valid. It then asynchronously analyzes the contents of the audio file or files
        and automatically extracts information about the audio such as its length,
        sampling rate, and encoding. You cannot submit requests to add additional audio
        resources to a custom acoustic model, or to train the model, until the service's
        analysis of all audio files for the current request completes.
        To determine the status of the service's analysis of the audio, use the **List an
        audio resource** method to poll the status of the audio. The method accepts the
        GUID of the custom model and the name of the audio resource, and it returns the
        status of the resource. Use a loop to check the status of the audio every few
        seconds until it becomes `ok`.
        ### Content types for audio-type resources
         You can add an individual audio file in any format that the service supports for
        speech recognition. For an audio-type resource, use the `Content-Type` parameter
        to specify the audio format (MIME type) of the audio file:
        * `audio/basic` (Use only with narrowband models.)
        * `audio/flac`
        * `audio/l16` (Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) and optionally the number of
        channels (`channels`) and endianness (`endianness`) of the audio.)
        * `audio/mp3`
        * `audio/mpeg`
        * `audio/mulaw` (Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) of the audio.)
        * `audio/ogg` (The service automatically detects the codec of the input audio.)
        * `audio/ogg;codecs=opus`
        * `audio/ogg;codecs=vorbis`
        * `audio/wav` (Provide audio with a maximum of nine channels.)
        * `audio/webm` (The service automatically detects the codec of the input audio.)
        * `audio/webm;codecs=opus`
        * `audio/webm;codecs=vorbis`
        For information about the supported audio formats, including specifying the
        sampling rate, channels, and endianness for the indicated formats, see [Audio
        formats](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/speech-to-text/audio-formats.html).
        **Note:** The sampling rate of an audio file must match the sampling rate of the
        base model for the custom model: for broadband models, at least 16 kHz; for
        narrowband models, at least 8 kHz. If the sampling rate of the audio is higher
        than the minimum required rate, the service down-samples the audio to the
        appropriate rate. If the sampling rate of the audio is lower than the minimum
        required rate, the service labels the audio file as `invalid`.
        ### Content types for archive-type resources
         You can add an archive file (**.zip** or **.tar.gz** file) that contains audio
        files in any format that the service supports for speech recognition. For an
        archive-type resource, use the `Content-Type` parameter to specify the media type
        of the archive file:
        * `application/zip` for a **.zip** file
        * `application/gzip` for a **.tar.gz** file.
        All audio files contained in the archive must have the same audio format. Use the
        `Contained-Content-Type` parameter to specify the format of the contained audio
        files. The parameter accepts all of the audio formats supported for use with
        speech recognition and with the `Content-Type` header, including the `rate`,
        `channels`, and `endianness` parameters that are used with some formats. The
        default contained audio format is `audio/wav`.

        :param str customization_id: The customization ID (GUID) of the custom acoustic
        model. You must make the request with service credentials created for the instance
        of the service that owns the custom model.
        :param str audio_name: The name of the audio resource for the custom acoustic
        model. When adding an audio resource, do not include spaces in the name; use a
        localized name that matches the language of the custom model.
        :param list[str] audio_resource: The audio resource that is to be added to the
        custom acoustic model, an individual audio file or an archive file.
        :param str content_type: The type of the input: application/zip, application/gzip,
        audio/basic, audio/flac, audio/l16, audio/mp3, audio/mpeg, audio/mulaw, audio/ogg,
        audio/ogg;codecs=opus, audio/ogg;codecs=vorbis, audio/wav, audio/webm,
        audio/webm;codecs=opus, or audio/webm;codecs=vorbis.
        :param str contained_content_type: For an archive-type resource, specifies the
        format of the audio files contained in the archive file. The parameter accepts all
        of the audio formats supported for use with speech recognition, including the
        `rate`, `channels`, and `endianness` parameters that are used with some formats.
        For a complete list of supported audio formats, see [Audio
        formats](/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#formats).
        :param bool allow_overwrite: If `true`, the specified corpus or audio resource
        overwrites an existing corpus or audio resource with the same name. If `false`
        (the default), the request fails if a corpus or audio resource with the same name

        model. By default, the dialect matches the language of the base model; for
        example, `en-US` for either of the US English language models. For Spanish models,
        the field indicates the dialect for which the model was created:
        * `es-ES` for Castilian Spanish (the default)
        * `es-LA` for Latin American Spanish
        * `es-US` for North American (Mexican) Spanish.
        :param list[str] versions: (optional) A list of the available versions of the
        custom language model. Each element of the array indicates a version of the base
        model with which the custom model can be used. Multiple versions exist only if the
        custom model has been upgraded; otherwise, only a single version is shown.
        :param str owner: (optional) The GUID of the service credentials for the instance
        of the service that owns the custom language model.
        :param str name: (optional) The name of the custom language model.
        :param str description: (optional) The description of the custom language model.
        :param str base_model_name: (optional) The name of the language model for which
        the custom language model was created.
        :param str status: (optional) The current status of the custom language model:
        * `pending` indicates that the model was created but is waiting either for
        training data to be added or for the service to finish analyzing added data.
        * `ready` indicates that the model contains data and is ready to be trained.
        * `training` indicates that the model is currently being trained.
        * `available` indicates that the model is trained and ready to use.
        * `upgrading` indicates that the model is currently being upgraded.
        * `failed` indicates that training of the model failed.
        :param int progress: (optional) A percentage that indicates the progress of the
        custom language model's current training. A value of `100` means that the model is
        fully trained. **Note:** The `progress` field does not currently reflect the
        progress of the training. The field changes from `0` to `100` when training is
        complete.
        :param str warnings: (optional) If the request included unknown parameters, the
        following message: `Unexpected query parameter(s) ['parameters'] detected`, where
        `parameters` is a list that includes a quoted string for each unknown parameter.
